# Single-motor-3-function-toy-robot-ATTINY85-version
Attiny85 (Arduino envroment SpenceKonde core) code and pcb files for a single motor ir controlled 3d printed robot toy.
There are 2 versions of the code.
attiny85_sony_ir_3_func.ino and it's attiny85_sony_ir_3_func.hex are for controlling the single motor 3 function robot.
It requires the switch to be hooked up to function.

attiny85_sony_ir_basic_pwm.ino and attiny85_sony_ir_basic_pwm.hex are for controlling the 2 function robot.
attiny85_sony_ir_basic_pwm.ino just runs the motor in forward or reverse with pwm speed control. It can also be used for basic testing of the board or simple motor control. It doesn't need the feedback switch.
